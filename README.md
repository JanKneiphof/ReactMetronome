## Metronome

This App is an Online Metronome, developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and designed with the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) Framework. Tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and the [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library). <br>
Note: I implemented a custom version of the ```type(...)``` method from the React Testing Library, the reasoning and implementation can be found here in [myUserTesting.js](https://github.com/JanKneiphof/ReactMetronome/blob/master/src/tests/myUserTesting.js)

It is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means that if you open the [App](https://jankneiphof.github.io/ReactMetronome) it caches everything it needs, so it can be used without an Internet Connection.
This is especially useful on Mobile Devices, where it can also be added to your Homescreen (at least if the Mobile Browser supports this feature).
